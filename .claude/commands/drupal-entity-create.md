# Drupal Content Entity Creation

Load and apply the Content Entity Creation skill for scaffolding custom Drupal entities.

Read the skill file at `entity-api/content-entity-creation.md` and use it to generate:

- Entity class with proper attribute-based definition
- Entity interface
- All required handler classes (ListBuilder, Forms, AccessControlHandler)
- Supporting YAML files (permissions, menu links, tasks, actions)
- Optional: bundle config entity if bundles are needed
- Optional: revision and translation support

Follow Drupal coding standards strictly. Provide complete, copy-paste-ready code.

Apply this to scaffold the entity the user is requesting.
