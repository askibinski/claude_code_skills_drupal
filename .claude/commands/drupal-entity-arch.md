# Drupal Entity Architecture

Load and apply the Entity Architecture skill for making informed decisions about Drupal entity types.

Read the skill file at `entity-api/entity-architecture.md` and use it to guide decisions about:

- Content entities vs configuration entities
- When to use bundles (subtypes)
- Revision support considerations
- Translation support considerations
- Combined revisionable + translatable patterns

Apply this guidance to the user's current task.
