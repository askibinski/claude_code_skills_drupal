# Drupal Entity Operations

Load and apply the Entity Operations skill for working with existing Drupal entities.

Read the skill file at `entity-api/entity-operations.md` and use it for:

- Loading entities (single, multiple, by properties)
- Entity queries with conditions, sorting, paging
- Creating and saving new entities
- Updating existing entities
- Deleting entities
- Rendering entities
- Access checking

Provide code that follows best practices:
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Always specify accessCheck() on queries
- Handle validation before saves
- Consider revision handling for revisionable entities

Apply this to help with the user's entity operation task.
